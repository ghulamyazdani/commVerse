## Community verse website

We want to create Community verse platform with a vision that “There should be a platform that should have free community-based learning”. As we have been into so many communities over the years, we have got to know the values of our community in ours. We know how communities can change the whole life of people. People don’t realize that there are communities everywhere and community plays an important role in their life too if they are using Twitter there is a whole tech twitter community, but they don’t have knowledge about it.

The CommunityVerse will provide students with a platform where they can get themselves a mentor at no cost. They could use the community verse platform to communicate with each other. Every student that comes to the communityVerse platform can get a dedicated mentor in the respective fields they require.

This platform even has study materials and an article system so that everyone can get the latest curated content and study what is new in the technology.
